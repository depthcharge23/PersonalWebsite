                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi my name is Aaron. I am a Full Stack Engineer based out of the Greater Seattle Area. I enjoy building
                    websites and learning new programming techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I currently develop software for Costco Wholesale, but I am interested in getting into the freelance development
                    space. I have experience developing apps in an Agile environment, providing backend and frontend solutions for our business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time I like to play video games, hang out with friends, eat good food, and do a little bit of photography. My favorite
                    things to photograph are people and landscapes. I am also a huge foodie and love to cook new things whenever I get the chance.
                </p>

                <h3>Kanto Pokedex App</h3>
                <p>
                    The Kanto Pokedex project was a personal project I wanted to work on. The idea was to scrape
                    Pokemon data from the website, Bulbapedia, and display it in a pokedex format.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The front-end section of the app was created in React with the help of Bootstrap. The back-end was
                    created in NodeJS using the ExpressJS server framework. All of the data was scraped off of Bulbapedia
                    using Python and the Beautiful Soup library. The data was loaded into a MongoDB instance. The app was hosted
                    on Microsoft Azure.
